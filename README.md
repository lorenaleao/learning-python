Here are some code files in Python: 

* **Simplex algorithm:** I had to implement the Simplex algorithm for the discipline Pesquisa Operacional (or Operational Research) (DCC035) offered by UFMG. This method was created by George Dantzig and, in mathematical optimization, is a popular algorithm for solving problems in linear programming. 
* **Solutions to some of the problems in this a2oj's practice ladder: [11 - Codeforces Rating < 1300](https://a2oj.com/ladder?ID=11)**
* **Solutions to the [MIT 6.0001 course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/index.htm) problem sets**
